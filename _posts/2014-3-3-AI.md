## AI
A branch of computer science that deals with the symbolic and non-algorithmic approach of problem-solving.

- Artificial Intelligence Applications
The artificial intelligence has already contributed a lot to the present world. Almost all the latest technology is due to the presence of AI. So now we will discuss the applications of AI. Its applications are as follows:

## Gaming:
These days there are so many games available. These games have amazing and real-world features. This is possible due to AI. So, it would be no wrong to say that artificial intelligence is playing an important part in tactical games such as poker, chess, tic-tac-toe, and many more. In these games, the machine is able to consider a big amount of potential steps on the basis of heuristic understanding.

### Expert System:
These days, we can find a number of applications that incorporate a device, software, and information for passing on reckoning and advising. They provide justification and suggestions to the user.

Natural Language Processing:
We must have seen and used the voice search system of Google search. We can search and browse anything with just our voice. And we get the results too. This is achievable by the artificial intelligence technique.

Speech Recognition:
With the advancement of artificial intelligence, these days some systems are competent in hearing and figure out the verbal communication in the form of sentences along with their meanings, while we communicate. It is capable of handling various tones of voice, colloquial speech words, noises in the surroundings, and many more.

Self-driving cars:
These days the development of self-driving cars and other vehicles are in the progress. These cars wonâ€™t have drivers and will drive on the basis of analyzing the traffic.

Google Maps:
All of us use Google maps. We see real-time traffic and get real-time suggestions for choosing away.

Prediction Engine:
E-commerce use prediction engine and lot. Whenever we buy something then we are suggested some more items. This is possible due to artificial intelligence.

Visualization System:
With the help of artificial intelligence we can develop a system that is capable of understanding, comprehending, and predicting an image fed in the system. For example:

A spying drone takes pictures of figures. That can be used for further operations or mapping the areas.
The diagnosis of illness and the depiction of internal organs can be performed with the help of artificial intelligence. These days, doctors use the expert system exclusively designed for clinical purposes.Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below :point_down:).
